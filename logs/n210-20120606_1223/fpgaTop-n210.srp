Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <rstSync> :
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 17-bit shift register was found for signal <reset_hold_16> and currently occupies 17 logic cells (8 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
