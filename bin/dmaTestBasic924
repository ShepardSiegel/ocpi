# dmaTestBasic - a script for dma "sanity" that runs in less than a minute

# dmaTestBasic924 - for the Altera alst4 platform on the Atomic Rules core 920 machine, pcie:4

# Notes:
# 2012-06-05 On the inital test of the tagged build alst4_20120605, this test hung the OS in
#   one of the master modes and a cold reset (power off then on) was applied. Subsequently,
#   this test ran in all DMA modes flawlessly. It is suspected there may be a warm-reset issue
#   that cause the "first run after bitstream load" to fail. Should this test fail, be sure to 
#   check if a cold-reset "fixes" the flaw.
