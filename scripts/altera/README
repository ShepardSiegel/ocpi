/home/shep/projects/ocpi/scripts/altera

This directory was used for early, tactical development of
the Altera PCIe EP on the platforms "htgs4" and "alst4"

1. The remaining directories were the last "known working" 
2. The .qsf constraint files were stripped of SignalTap and copied to ucf/<platform>.qsf
