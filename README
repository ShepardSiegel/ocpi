1. Getting Started
  Browse the documentation at $(OCPI_DIR)/doc
  When you see a sub-dir named "pen", that is a "holding-pen" for files that may be depricated

  To build a bitstream, first make sure the appropriate tools are installed
    e.g. Install Xilinx ISE 12.x to build Xilinx bitstreams
    As of 2010-12-18 ISE 12.4 or greater is required for Xilinx builds.
    If you are not using the same tools version as the distribution, you may need to rebuild XST libraries

  Source code is under git verson control - if you care, install git and say
    $ git status

2. Building a Bitstream for a Target

  Set the environment variable OCPI_DIR to point to this distribution
    e.g. setenv OCPI_DIR $(HOME)/projects/ocpi

  You may need to set certain environment variables, for example...
    source /opt/Xilinx/12.4/ISE_DS/settings64.csh
    setenv XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE 1
    setenv XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE  1

  If needed, first specialize the HDL sources for a particular target. (We plan to remove the need for this step in a future release). 

  From $(OCPI_DIR) say
    $ make <target>
  where <target> is one of these platform names..
     ml555
     alder
     schist
     xupv5
     biotite
     nf10
     illite
     ml605
     sp605
     alcy4
     htgs4

  Make will copy files into $(OCPI_DIR)/build/tmp-<target> and run the vendor tools. When the build sucessfully completes, the build/tmp-<target> directory will be remaned build/<target>-<timestamp>

3. Loading the a Bitstream for the First Time
  OpenCPI allows you to load a bitstream while the Linux host is running. However to achieve this capability, there is the one-time requirement of loading an OpenCPI bitsream into Flash so that the BIOS sees an OpenCPI PCIe endpoint when Linux boots.

4. Normal (not the first time) Loading of the bitstream
  Use $(OCPI_DIR)/scripts/loadBitStreamXXXX <bitstream.bit> <pcie slot> <usb port>
  e.g $ ./loadBitStreamSX95 ../build/sx95t-20100608_1209/fpgaTop.bit 0000:03:00.0 usb21

5. Setting Host to Reserve Memory to Allows User-Mode DMA w/o Kernel-Mode Driver
   5.1 Edit grub.conf to reserve 256MB of memory...
   e.g. 	kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-194.3.1.el5 ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet memmap=256M$0x5f700000
   5.2 Set env vars to use that memory (still using old version in some programs)
     setenv CPI_DMA_MEMORY        256M\$0x5f700000     # depricated use on 2010-05-25
     setenv OCPI_DMA_MEMORY       256M\$0x5f700000

 6. Running a DMA Sanity Test from $(OCPI_DIR)/bin (you probably need set addresses in script)
      [shep@core960 bin]$ ./dmaTestBasic
      admin probe 
      OCCP Admin Space

7.  Running a functional simulation of DMA with ISim
      $ make isim

8.  Compiling infrastructure IP written in BSV using the Bluespec compilier (requires bsc)
      $ make platform_{xupv5|ml555|schist|ml605}
      (see Makefile for valid targets)

9. FAQs
  "My bitstream build failed, where can I look to see what went wrong?"
     Look in the $OCPIDIR/scripts/buildhdl directory at the script "build_fpgaTop" and then at the appropriate
     .xst and .prj files. Also look in the $OCPIDIR/build/tmp-<target> directory, where an incomplete build's
     artifacts will remain.

  "I want to learn more about Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV), where do I start?"
     The e-Book "Bluespec by Example is a good place...  (bsv_by_example.pdf)
